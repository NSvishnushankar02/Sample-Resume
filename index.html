        Optical Character Recognition using the MNIST dataset" is a project aimed at developing a high-precision system for automatically<br>
        recognising handwritten characters from images. By utilising the extensive MNIST dataset, this project employs advanced machine<br>
        learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to train models capable of accurately deciphering handwritten<br>
        digits and characters. Through rigorous preprocessing and model optimization, the project seeks to achieve exceptional accuracy and<br>
        robustness in recognising handwritten text, with applications spanning document digitization, text extraction, and handwriting analysis.<br></p>
